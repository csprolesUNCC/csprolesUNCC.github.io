                        Here's a fun post to kick off 2026. Today I'm listing my top 5 NHL goal songs (As of January 2026), in descending order, 
                        because I didn't want to write something long this time.
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. Chicago Blackhawks</h3>
                    <p>Chelsea Dagger - The Fratellis</p>
                    <iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3A14DujbBiSPjOEvON6Dpk?utm_source=generator&theme=0"
                     width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 
                     loading="lazy"></iframe>
                    <p>
                        Since 2008, the Blackhawks have been using this as a goal song, and I think if they ever change it, the city might burn to the ground. 
                        Not only is it iconic and catchy, it's perfect for chanting along with even when you're 9 beers deep. It's a song that you can 
                        listen to easily outside of a game, and it will get you pumped up. Match a song like that with a team with a deep history such as 
                        Chicago, and you have a match that can't be separated.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Colorado Avalanche</h3>
                    <p>Chase The Sun - Planet Funk</p>
                    <iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2PHp8jhEkUv8TOZnem5kH0?utm_source=generator&theme=0" 
                    width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 
                    loading="lazy"></iframe>
                    <p>
                        This one has everything a goal song needs. It's high energy, loud, and gives the fans a chance to chant with it. 
                        It's been in use since 2017, and I hope they keep it around for a while, because even just hearing it on a video, 
                        it feels absolutely electric.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Boston Bruins</h3>
                    <p>Kernkraft 400 - Zombie Nation</p>
                    <iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7mPhl3Put8aKxiFuCP7Hvk?utm_source=generator&theme=0" 
                    width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 
                    loading="lazy"></iframe>
                    <p>
                        Kernkraft 400 is easily in the top 5 of "Most iconic sports anthems" alongside songs such as Seven Nation Army and Sandstorm. It is one of 
                        the defining sports anthems of the modern era, and frankly the only thing keeping it from #1 or #2 is that it isn't exactly a unique pick 
                        for a goal song. Still, #3 is a great spot to be in.
                    </p>

                    <h3>4. Dallas Stars</h3>
                    <p>Puck Off - Pantera</p>
                    <iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3PtHVW1LBPgz2ynvQDp3wp?utm_source=generator&theme=0" 
                    width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 
                    loading="lazy"></iframe>
                    <p>
                        Another easy one for the list. This song was literally made <i>for</i> the Stars. It has a back and forth chant, followed up by some guitar to keep everyone 
                        amped up as they players get ready to resume play. Can only imagine how it sounds in person.
                    </p>

                    <h3>5. Carolina Hurricanes</h3>
                    <p>Raise Up - Petey Pablo</p>
                    <iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6j07SSymCxAOV3ZtpDU82K?utm_source=generator&theme=0" 
                    width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 
                    loading="lazy"></iframe>
                    <p>
                        I may be letting some bias through, but the Hurricanes have a great song pick with Raise Up. While not the most exciting song by some 
                        definitions, it makes up for that in it's identity. Lucky for the Canes, no other team can use this song, simply for the fact that it's 
                        about North Carolina.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Dishonorable Mention: Florida Panthers</h3>
                    <p>Panthers Pulse - Ownboss ft. Sevek</p>
                    <iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6iyCeNSV9mS6ytzt0eeJub?utm_source=generator&theme=0" 
                    width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 
                    loading="lazy"></iframe>
                    <p>
                        Now, my feelings for this one, while partially fueled by my extreme disdain for the Panthers, primarily comes from the fact that this song 
                        simply feels forced. It starts with a lazy chant, followed by an uninspired electronic beat. It feels very corporate in a sense. I'm definitely not 
                        just saying this because they hurt Jarvis.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Slightly Less Dishonorable Mention: Toronto Maple Leafs</h3>
                    <p>Düp Düp - Mickie Krause</p>
                    <iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4C3b5zTNboQvWMDZXmSZGO?utm_source=generator&theme=0" 
                    width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 
                    loading="lazy"></iframe>
                    <p>
                        Come on guys. This is just the Av's goal song but redone by some German guy. This isn't their all time goal song I believe, but still, come on.
                    </p>
