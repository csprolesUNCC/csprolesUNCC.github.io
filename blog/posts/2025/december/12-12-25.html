                        I'm writing this following my graduation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I want to keep this one short. I just got home from my graduation ceremony at the time of writing this. 
                        My experience going in was full of nervousness and excitement. It was everything you would expect to feel initially. 
                        However, after getting seated and watching as the first few rows of graduates walked across the stage, a painful 
                        feeling started to creep over me. I felt like I was out of place, like I shouldn't be there, like I wasn't as good as 
                        everyone around me. I can't even shake that feeling as I'm writing this. It sucks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This feeling just rained over me through the whole ceremony, and even as I came home to see my parents, it wouldn't leave. 
                        I had this voice in my head saying I barely scraped by, and that was unacceptable. It didn't matter to me in my head 
                        that I did the work that was needed. Something in me was disappointed. Maybe it was some internal thought about what I 
                        was scared of my parents thinking, maybe it's just another manifestation of my fear of what's next. I wish I knew the answer.
                    </p>

                    <p>If anyone reading has the same feelings, at least know you aren't alone with them. Maybe if I find a way to deal with those feelings, I'll make a follow up post.</p>
