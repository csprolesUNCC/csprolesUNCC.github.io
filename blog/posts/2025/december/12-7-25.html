                    <p>In less than a week from the time of writing this post, I will be walking across the stage in Halton Arena, receiving my Bachelors degree in Computer Science.</p>

                    <p>This post is just an introduction and me sharing my plans going forward.</p>

                    <h3>My plan for this site.</h3>
                    <p>This site is intended to allow me a way to exercise the skills I learned in college. It is a personal project, which will likely only be viewed by people I provide the link to. Still, I will make an effort to stay active here.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "The best way to learn is by doing."
                    </blockquote>

                    <h3>What will I post about?</h3>
                    <p>I will be posting about whatever comes to mind. That could be my thoughts on a Hurricanes game, my opinion on a Gamecocks coaching hire, speculations about upcoming video games, or even just a post about my dog.</p>

                    <h3>When will I post?</h3>
                    <p>My goal is to post at least once every two weeks. I may not always hit that mark, but I will try my best to stay consistent.</p>

                    <p>I hope to see some support during this new journey, and hope to expand this site beyond what is already implemented.</p>
