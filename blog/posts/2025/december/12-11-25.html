                    <p>I sat down to talk with my close friend, Will, and talked to him about his experiences with finishing college.</p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Recount your thoughts as you're approaching Graduation.</h3>
                        <p><strong>Will: </strong></p>
                        <p><i>
                            Yeah, so me specifically, I approach change very much—the farther away I am 
                            from the change, the more daunting it seems to me. I've always been my 
                            whole life kind of afraid of change. And when I see it approaching, especially 
                            from the beginning of this semester, knowing it was my last semester, it's 
                            almost like a wave. It looks really, really, really daunting from far away, 
                            and I always think, "Oh my goodness, this wave is too big. This wave is gonna swallow me and crush me."
                        </i></p>

                        <p><i>
                            And so, the first half of the semester, I really just had the mindset where I 
                            was like, "Oh my gosh, look at what I'm gonna be leaving behind," because I've 
                            made a lot of friends here, and I've made a lot of experiences here, and things 
                            that I was thinking I was gonna just be so, so sad and distraught to leave 
                            because I built my life around here and lived here for a couple of years.
                        </i></p>

                        <p><i>
                            But recently, the past couple of weeks actually, it's been an absolute blessing. 
                            I've had a total, total change in perspective, because the science really is: 
                            you can't fear and be grateful at the same time. It's impossible based on how 
                            those—the waves that those thoughts produce.
                        </i></p>

                        <p><i>
                            So instead, I start every morning and <strong>I try to out-grateful myself.</strong> I'm just like, 
                            so thankful: "Thank you, Lord. I'm so thankful that you sent your son. Thank you for 
                            my friends, thank you for where I'm at, and Liberty, and everything I've done and 
                            accomplished. Thank you for the friends that I have made."
                        </i></p>

                        <p><i>
                            And when you say "I'm thankful," and say it so much, it almost puts it in like a past 
                            tense, 'cause like, I'm thankful for what happened. Instead of, "Oh my gosh, look what 
                            I'm going to miss out on," it's more, "Look at the experiences I was able to have."
                        </i></p>

                        <p><i>
                            And so now, throughout my day, as I experience things, at the beginning of the semester 
                            if I would have experienced that, I'd have been like, "Oh no, I won't be able to go to 
                            the gym anymore. I'll miss times like this." But now it's more, <strong>"I'm thankful so much for 
                            times like this."</strong> I'm grateful now when I leave that I'll be able to look back at all these 
                            fun times, and it gets me... I feel more at peace.
                        </i></p>

                        <p><i>
                            Because in the moment, if you're thinking about missing the moment, when you look back, 
                            all you were doing in the moment was missing the moment and not actually living in the moment. 
                            So it also helps you more live in the moment. So because of that, only really recently have 
                            I been at peace about leaving college and my time here at Liberty.
                        </i></p>
