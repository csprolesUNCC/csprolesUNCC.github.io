                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>It's that wonderful time of year where everything is cold and wet, and you hear the same song everywhere you go.</p>

                    <p>
                        That's not to say there's an issue with that. I'm quite fond of this time of year. 
                        It's a perfect time to let things slow down a bit, and think over the year that is coming to a close. 
                        It's a time of family, friends, and the best excuse to sit inside and eat tasty food.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For most people, there are at least one or two big things that happen every year. 
                        For me, I graduated college, and watched two of my closest friends get married (not to each other). 
                        That's only the beginning of the list, but still to come is the time I get to spend with family 
                        and friends during the holiday season.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What's Important</h3>
                    <p>
                        This time of year holds a lot of importance to many people for different reasons. 
                        Arguably the most common, is that it provides the environment and excuses to slow down 
                        and catch up with those around you. We are social creatures, and even for someone who may 
                        be more introverted, it's still important to have that connection with others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It isn't just about family and friends, though. The Holidays are a time to let yourself relax, 
                        and take a break from the business of everyday life. We already stress too much as is, and for 
                        some, the holidays add on even more stress. So, to anyone who might read this, make sure you set 
                        aside some personal time. Spend a day playing a game you love, finish that show you started a month ago, 
                        maybe even brave the cold and go camping for a weekend. The only thing that matters is that you give yourself 
                        a break.
                    </p>

                    <p>It's been a long year for all of us, some more than others.</p>
