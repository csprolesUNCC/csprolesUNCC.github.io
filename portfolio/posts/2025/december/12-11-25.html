                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>I sat down to talk with my close friend, Will, and talked to him about his experiences with finishing college.</p>

                    <p>
                        
                    </p>

                    <h3>My Goals.</h3>
                    <p>
                        My first goal is to secure some sort of job. Currently I work blue collar labor, which keeps me afloat financially, but doesn't provide the career that I want. 
                        That job has been great to me, but it would kill me long term. What I really want is to find a tech job that allows me to work in the aviation industry.
                         While I don't have a degree in anything aviation related, I do have a passion for it, and I believe that passion can carry me far.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams… he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours." -Henry David Thoreau
                    </blockquote>

                    <h3>My Fears.</h3>
                    <p>While I know that my parents fully support me, and I have what it takes to find success inside of me, it's still scary entering this unknown world.
                        Thoughts are constantly in my head about "What if I don't find a job?" or "What if I'm not good enough?" but what I have to tell myself is that 
                        persistence and confidence is key. I am in a very fortunate position to have a 4 year degree, and even with an industry as competitive as computer science,
                         I still have a step above many others, even if I don't end up in my dream job right away, or even one in the right field.
                    </p>

                    <h3>My Point.</h3>
                    <p>The point of this post is to remind myself of my thoughts and worries, and put them down in a place where I can reference later and see how far I've come.</p>

                    <p>I plan to follow this post up with a short interview/chat with one of my best friends, and get some words from him on how he dealt with this stage of his life.</p>
